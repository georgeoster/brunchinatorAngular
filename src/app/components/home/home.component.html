      It started as a simple tool to help me remember where I liked the bloody mary.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Then I wanted to know what my friends thought too. 
      So I added users.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Those friends wanted to rate burgers as well as bloodys. 
      So I added burgers.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      So now you can see what other people have to say, 
      and if you want to leave some reviews yourself you can 
      <span class="text-indigo-600 font-semibold cursor-pointer" (click)="routeTo(ROUTE_NAMES.SIGN_UP)">
        create an account
      </span>  
      and join in on the fun.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      What's next? I have some ideas I'm working on, but it depends what the people want!
      Got an idea for a feature? Send me an email at 
      <span class="text-indigo-700 font-semibold">admin&#64;brunchinator.com</span> 
      and let's talk!
